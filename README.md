# i3-gaps-desktop

This is a fork of [i3-gaps](README.gaps.md) window manager that supports desktop
manager windows (those of type `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP`). This includes
SpaceFM, PCmanFM, and other desktop managers.

The patch adding their support has originally been written by Alessandro Grassi
and published in the [i3-extras](https://github.com/ashinkarov/i3-extras) repo.
I've ported it to the latest i3-gaps.

See [the original patch README](README.desktop.md).
